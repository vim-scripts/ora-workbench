The ORA-Workbench is a VIM plugin to use VIM a development environment for
ORACLE databases. 

The ORA-Workbench shows the typical layout of modern development environment consiting
of:
	- the object tree on the left side
	- a editing area in upper right 
	- a "log" window in the lower right

The workbench requires a Oracle Client installation (I'm calling SQLPLUS). The
program "sqlplus" must be in the "path". 

This plugin has been tested with:
	- vim*7.2
	- ORACLE*10.2
	- MS Windows 2000
	- SUSE Linux*10
